# Underpass

## Requirements

It seems you need to use Node 8 (it fails with Node 12, not sure about 10).

## How to run

- Install the dependencies : `npm i`
- Install Bower: `npm i -g bower`
- Download the Bower deps: `bower install`
- Run the prod version: `npm run prod`

## Disclaimer

This piece of software is very outdated, and I'm not planning on upgrading anything in the foresable future.

It would probably need to be rewritten from scratch (at least the for the UI).

Bower is still operational but deprecated, so it could stop working in the future.
